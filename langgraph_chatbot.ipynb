This graph consists of a set of nodes, each representing a word in the sentence, and a set of directed edges, each representing a grammatical dependency between two words.\n",

            "A Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) is a mathematical representation of the dependency graph. It is a square matrix where the rows and columns represent words in the sentence, and the entry at row i and column j indicates the dependency relationship between the word at row i and the word at column j.\n",

            "3. Analyze the syntax and semantics of a sentence.\n",
            "4. Study the properties of languages, such as word order, grammatical relations, and dependency patterns.\n",
